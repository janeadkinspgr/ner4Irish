# Named Entity Recognition for the Irish Language

## Contents:
- [**`Project Proposal`**](https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/collih22/2024-ca4021-n.e.r-for-gaeilge/-/blob/main/docs/Named%20Entity%20Recognition%20for%20the%20Irish%20Language%20Proposal.pdf): This file contains the details of our proposal to construct a Named Entity Recognition (NER) tool for the Irish Language. This proposal discusses the motivation for the project, the problem to be solved, state of the art technologies in the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for Irish and our plan on how to build the NER tool.
- [**`Final Report`**](https://gitlab.computing.dcu.ie/collih22/2024-ca4021-n.e.r-for-gaeilge/-/blob/main/docs/Final_report_with_annotation_guidelines.pdf?ref_type=heads): This is our final report for Named Entity Recognition for the Irish Language. This report discusses the Irish language technology space, named entity recognition, data augmentation techniques, neural architectures for the NER task, our dataset construction, our experiments and presents our results and findings.
- [**`Annotation`**](./Annotation): This folder contains details to do with the annotation process of the data collected, in particular the guidelines to be followed throughout.
- [**`Statistics`**](./Data/Statistics): This folder contains code run on the data collected to gain insight into the spread of entities across datasets.
- [**`Models`**](./Models): This folder contains each model trained on the data and their evaluations.
- [**`Data`**](./Data): This folder contains all of the data collected for the project.
